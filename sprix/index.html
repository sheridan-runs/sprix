          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For 99% of runners, the best strategy is Even Splits (running the same pace for the entire race) or Negative Splits (running the second half slightly faster). This conserves glycogen stores for the final 10km."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No. Banking time leads to hitting the wall. For every minute you run too fast in the first half, you will likely lose 2-3 minutes in the second half due to accumulated fatigue."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The Wall typically happens around 30km due to glycogen depletion. To avoid it: 1) Run an even pace (don't start too fast), 2) Consume gels every 30-45 minutes from the start, and 3) Hydrate at every aid station."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The cheapest method is clear wide packing tape. Print your band, lay it flat, and cover both sides completely with tape before cutting it out. This makes it sweat-proof and rain-proof."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Loop it around your wrist and tape the ends together. Ensure it is loose enough to rotate (so you can read splits for the later kilometers) but tight enough that it will not slide off your hand."
